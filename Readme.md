## 👋 Welcome to Super Obvious interview 👋

### About this process

* This is a basic mobile app on React Native written in TypeSript
* ~ 45 min pairing exercise, to simulate a real working environment
* Goal is to complete some missing functionality in the app.
* Focus on code quality, you're the owner of the code. Don't be scared to suggest better solutions ☺️

### About the app
* Very simple form, that has a screen to capture users name
* On the button click two HTTP requests are being sent out - to predict the users age and gender.
* On successful form submission user is navigated to the next screen, where he/she can see the predicted data.
* [Optional] - store the data to AsyncStorage for historical data
* [Optional] - show historical data on another screen


### Have fun!
